+Can you take a look at `App.js` and modify it to fit this description. The web app should let the user take or upload a picture of their food, then have a vision language model analyse it to make suggestions for swaps. Right now you should just create the interface, using dummy values. The analysis section should be off to the side. Also tell me how to set up the react project. This prototype needs really unique and impressive visuals, and right now we don't have anything close to that. I think the uploaded image should make up the bulk of the screen, use a placeholder image until the user adds theirs, and the AI suggestions should fall in around the screen. Take a look at the unique typography used in this other site, and how visual content takes up the majority of the screen. I want to create something like this.
